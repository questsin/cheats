# The Framework and Other Industry Process Models = 
- ITIL 
- COBIT
- PCF 
- SCOR;
- ITIL = (Information Technology Infrastructure Library);
- COBIT =  (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology);
- PCF = (Process Classification Framework);
- SCOR = (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model);

## ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) 4 areas =
- four practice areas: service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation;
- Enterprise domain = ITIL processes placed in the Enterprise domain since Enterprise domain defines policies for other domains;
## ITIL Mapping to TMF = 
- GB921W - ITIL / eTOM
- GB921L
- GB921Q - FAQ
- TR143;

## COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) =
- links business goals to IT goals
- good practices to control quality and risk';
- cobit two main process domains = gvernance, management;
- cobit governance has five processes =
    1. value delivery, 
    2. risk management, 
    3. resource management, 
    4. performance measurement, 
    5. strategic alignment;
- cobit management =
    1. align, 
    2. plan and organize, 
    3. build/acquire and implement, 
    4. deliver service and support, monitor, evaluate, and assess;
- COBIT domains are aligned with = eTOM vertical process categories;
    - cobit "align, plan and organize" = "strategy & commit";
    - cobit "build/acquire and implement" = "infrastructure lifecycle management";
    - cobit "deliver service and support" = some Operations verticals;
    - cobit "monitor, evaluate and assess"=> the Enterprise domain's "enterprise effectiveness; management" core process =
    - no mappings to the "billing and revenue management" vertical, nor to the "product lifecycle management" vertical;

## PCF (Process Classification Framework) =
- process management and benchmarking
- can be downloaded at no charge
- there are no process descriptions of the first-level processes
- descriptions of the lower-level processes are available to members;
- two pcf groups = operating processes (similar to SIP and OPS), management and support services (similar to Enterprise Domain)
- each has six categories
- hundreds of processes
- difficult to map to eTOM;

## SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model) 4 reference areas =
- four reference areas: DCOR, CCOR, M4SC, PLCOR;
- DCOR = (`design` chain operations reference model): product and process design;
- CCOR = (`customer chain` operations reference model): sales and support;
- M4SC = (`managing for supply chain` performance);
- PLCOR = (`product lifecycle` operations reference model);
- SCORE has both process frameworks and = best practices information;
- DCOR maps to = several areas in the product domain and the enterprise domain;
- CCOR maps to = the market / sales domain and the customer domain;
- M4SC maps to = the engaged party domain;
- PLCOR maps to = the product lifecycle management vertical grouping;
