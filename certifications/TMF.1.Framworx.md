Frameworx Best Practices
- suite of best practivces and standards that provide the blueprint for effective, efficient business operations
- goals: increase agility; reduce cost and risk; enable deployment of new services and products; provide a common point of reference; accelerate realization of benefits
- business processes need to change to work in a "value fabric"; e.g. devops, increase in self-service

- security, privacy, and risk management KPIs
- customer centric goals: increasing profitability; deliver a personalized customer experience; future-proofing customer experience
- customer experience resources: guidebook; ROI calculator; lifecycle model; metrics library; big data analystics; use case library
- customer experience lifecycle model:
	- three phases: engaging; using; evaluating
- measuring customer experience: approx 550 customer experience metrics (out of 1,700 total Metrics)
- search for "metric definitions"
- big data analytics (BDA): reference model; use cases mapped to eTOM (often used for RFPs); external data monetization; building blocks (implement); maturity model (assessment tool); analytics and big data repository
- open partnering best practices: solving digital service management practices; optimizing ecosystem participation; rapidly addressing business problems
- digital world challenges: IoT; IoE (Internet of Everything)
