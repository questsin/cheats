# Business Process Framework (eTOM) 
The Business Process Framework
- catalog and classification scheme
- `Domains, core processes, tasks`
- any number of levels of core processes

## The Business Process Framework (eTOM) Goals
1. Provide an `enterprise wide process discipline`
2. Be `consistent` and `re-use`
3. Develop `clearer IT requirements`
4. Reduce `management time and cost`
5. Manage `complex business relationships`

## The Business Process Framework (eTOM) Uses
1. Define project `scope`
2. Support `procurement` requests
3. Focus `process related` discussions
4. `Transform` business processes
5. `Map roles, owners /organizations`

# Terms
Vertical Domain Areas = Strategy , Infa, Prudct(SIP) vs Ops
SIP process groupings = Strategy & Commit, Infra LC M, Product, LC M,
Ops process groupings = Ops Support & Readiness, Fullfilment, Assurance, Billing and Revenue M (FAB)
BPF Domains= Distict group of processes
ABE = Core Process element > Task Level process elements 
Process Area = Strategy, Infrastructure and Product (SIP) and Operations (Ops).
Process Groupings SIP = Strategy & Commit; Infrastructure Lifecycle Management; Product Lifecycle Management
Process Ops Grouping = Operations Support & Readiness; Fulfuillment; Assurance; Billing & Revenue Management (FAB)
Task Level process elements (level 2) ~SDLC 
BPF Common Domain = Common Process patterns (no meaning outside the context of other ABE)

# Notes
process patterns
- "core process" - manages the `lifecycle` of or more key business entities
	- naming convention: start with a noun "e.g. Product Offering Lifecycle Management"
- "tasks" `follow` the core process
	- naming convention: start with a verb "e.g. Manage Product Offering Exit"
- no process is duplicated in the framework
