Vertical Domain Areas = Strategy , Infa, Prudct(SIP) vs Ops
SIP process groupings, Infa, Prudct(SIP) = Strategy & Commit, Infra LC M, Product, LC M,
Ops process groupings = Ops Support & Readiness, Fullfilment, Assurance, Billing and Revenue M (FAB)
BPF Domains= Distict group of processes
ABE = Core Process element > Task Level process elements 
Task Level process elements (level 2) ~SDLC 
BPF Common Domain = Common Process patterns (no meaning outside the context of other ABE)

The Business Process Framework
- catalog and classification scheme
- `Domains, core processes, tasks`
- any number of levels of core processes
clear IT requirements; reduce management time and cost
- used to: define project scope; transform business processes; support procurement requests; map roles/organizations; focus process-related discussions
process patterns
- "core process" - manages the lifecycle of or more key business entities
	- naming convention: start with a noun "e.g. Product Offering Lifecycle Management"
- "tasks" follow the core process
	- naming convention: start with a verb "e.g. Manage Product Offering Exit"
- no process is duplicated in the framework
- First Level Categorization is the Process Area. There are two: Strategy, Infrastructure and Product (SIP) and Operations (Ops).
- Second Level Categorization is the Process Groupings. 
- Under SIP are Strategy & Commit; Infrastructure Lifecycle Management; Product Lifecycle Management
- Under Ops are: Operations Support & Readiness; Fulfuillment; Assurance; Billing & Revenue Management (FAB)
