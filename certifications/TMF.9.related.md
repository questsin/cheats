# The Framework and Other Industry Process Models
- ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)
- COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology)
- PCF (Process Classification Framework)
- SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model)

## ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)
- four practice areas: service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation
- ITIL processes placed in the Enterprise domain since Enterprise domain defines policies for other domains
- GB921W - ITIL / eTOM
- GB921L
- GB921Q - FAQ
- TR143

## COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology)
- good practices to control quality and risk
- two main process domains: 
- governance has five processes: 
    1. value delivery; 
    2. risk management; 
    3. resource management; 
    4. performance measurement; 
    5. strategic alignment
- management 
    1. align, 
    2. plan and organize; 
    3. build/acquire and implement; 
    4. deliver service and support; monitor, evaluate, and assess
- links business goals to IT goals
- COBIT domains are aligned with eTOM vertical process categories
    - "align, plan and organize" > "strategy & commit"
    - "build/acquire and implement" > "infrastructure lifecycle management"
    - "deliver service and support" > some Operations verticals
    - "monitor, evaluate and assess" > the Enterprise domain's "enterprise effectiveness management" core process
    - no mappings to the "billing and revenue management" vertical, nor to the "product lifecycle management" vertical

## PCF (Process Classification Framework)
- process management and benchmarking
- can be downloaded at no charge
- there are no process descriptions of the first-level processes
- descriptions of the lower-level processes are available to members
- two groups: operating processes (similar to SIP and OPS); management and support services (similar to Enterprise Domain)
- each has six categories
- hundreds of processes
- difficult to map to eTOM

## SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model)
- four reference areas: DCOR; CCOR; M4SC; PLCOR
- DCOR (`design` chain operations reference model): product and process design
- CCOR (`customer chain` operations reference model): sales and support
- M4SC (`managing for supply chain` performance)
- PLCOR (`product lifecycle` operations reference model)
- has both process frameworks and best practices information
- DCOR maps to several areas in the product domain and the enterprise domain
- CCOR maps to the market / sales domain and the customer domain
- M4SC maps to the engaged party domain
- PLCOR maps to the product lifecycle management vertical grouping
