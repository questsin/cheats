Every Azure web site has an associated 'scm' service site, which runs both Kudu and other Site Extensions. Kudu is the central nervous system of a Microsoft Azure Web Site; it handles the Git integration to a Web Site as well as provides an API endpoint for programmatic access to app settings, deployment information, files, active processes, runtime versions, source control information, web hooks and web jobs. Kudu, itself, is a Site Extension which is provided with ever Web Site, you can access it by using the Source Control Management entry point
If your web site has URL http://mysite.azurewebsites.net/, then the root URL of the Kudu service is https://mysite.scm.azurewebsites.net/
A BACPAC file is a ZIP file with an extension of BACPAC containing the metadata and data from a SQL Server database.
