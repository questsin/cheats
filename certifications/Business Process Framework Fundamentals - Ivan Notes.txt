MODULE 1

Framework Introduction
- enterprise-wide process decomposition or structured outline
- catalog and classification scheme
- five goals: enterprise-wide; manage complex business relationships; consistent process flows; develop clear IT requirements / understand application portfolios; reduce management time and cost

MODULE 2

Framework Structure
- used to: define project scope; transform business processes; support procurement requests; map roles/organizations (define organization boundaries); focus process-related discussions; manage KPIs
- "domain" - collection of core processes associated with a specific management area
- eight domains: market/sales; product; customer;service;resource;engaged party;enterprise;common process patterns
- "core process" - manages the lifecycle of or more key business entities
	- naming convention: start with a noun "e.g. Product Offering Lifecycle Management"
	- starts with a capital letter
- "tasks" follow the core process
	- naming convention: start with a verb then the core process name "e.g. Manage Product Offering Exit"
	- starts with a capital letter
- no process is duplicated in the framework
- First Level Categorization is the Process Area. There are two: Strategy, Infrastructure and Product (SIP) and Operations (Ops).
- Second Level Categorization is the Process Groupings. 
- Under SIP are Strategy & Commit; Infrastructure Lifecycle Management; Product Lifecycle Management
- Under Ops are: Operations Support & Readiness; Fulfuillment; Assurance; Billing & Revenue Management (FAB)
- Market / Sales Domain: 
- Product Domain: 
- Customer Domain: 
- Service Domain:
- Resource Domain: compute and storage; associates products & services to resources; provides usage data
- Engaged Party Domain: individuals or organizations involved with an enterprise (was Supplier-Partner)
- Enterprise Domain: policy for overall enterprise
- Common Process Patterns Domain: re-usable processes that can be used across the enterprise; e.g. capacity managemment; unique to this domain is that processes cannot execute on their own

MODULE 3 (Part 1)
Business Process Framework Uses

Cabelvision Case Study

Framework Use Cases
- developing process flows
- defining project scope
- plan, design, test, and deploy applications
- transforming business processes
- procurement request support
- role/organization mapping
- managing key performance indicators
- focus process related discussions

eTOM can and should play a role in development... especially planning, ready-made set of requirements, and high-level use cases
"use cases" inherit the business properties of a "task" and adds more detail regarding the interaction between processes and information.
use case steps can be the task's sub-tasks.
use cases are organized by domain, core process within the domain, and categorized using a vertical process grouping

Procurement (RFP): scope can be expressed in terms of eTOM's business processes. Can then be used to determine conformance to the framework using the framework's point system.

Role/Organizing Mapping: can used eTOM to perform RACI or RASCI analysis. Can use eTOM sub-processes to determine ownership. 
   Resources are allocated to Responsible.
   Support will assist in completing the task.
   Consulted may provide input.

KPIs (such as cost) can be associated with each step in a process flow. Then you can use a simulation tool to compute end-to-end process cost.

Q. What are two reasons why an enterprise should use the framework to focus process related discussions?
A. Reducing the reliance on the subject matter expertise of members of a team assembled to solve the problem and keeping discussions from becoming unfocused and wandering off in different directions.

Business Process Framework Uses

MODULE 4
The Framework and Business Process Transformation
- three approaches: bottom-up; top-down; hybrid
- if you only have process flows then use bottom-up
- if you only have process decomposition then use top-down

step 1: define scope
- process swim lanes
- information flows
- material flows
- financial flows
- need SMEs in both the in-scope items and in eTOM

bottom-up approach
- build a spreadsheet with the following columns:
	- flow step ID; process name; (F)low or (D)ecomp; source of input; decomp req'd; equivalent business process framework process + ID, equivalence type
	- equivalence type can be: "enterprise gap" meaning the flow is missing an eTOM process or, "full match", or "partial match" to an eTOM process. In the latter, add to the eTOM process's description.
- extensions to eTOM should be clearly noted so they are not wiped out at the next eTOM update

three key considerations
- any shared processes? put them in Enterprise or Common Process Patterns
- take care not to group processes according to organization (as organizations change)
- introduce specialized processes at the lowest level possible

how to extend/confirm a framework implementation
- semantic analysis: analyzes the description of a process for clues to the sub-tasks; look for (1) nouns upon which actions are performed (2) look for nouns (3) look for phrases that imply actions on nouns
- lifecycle decomposition:
	tangible (product lifecycle management) entities: look for "gather", "develop", "deploy"
	intangible (strategy) entities look for "research", "approve", "assess"
	activity (assurance) entities look for "issue"; "analyze"; "fix"
	- should have 7 +/- 2 first level processes
		- should have 5 +/- 2 sub-processes
		- process should never decompose into a single sub-process
additional guidance
- retain framework as a baseline
- implement a subset of the process areas
- add core processes; or elevate task-level process to a core process
- split task-level processes; this is where task specialization occurs

MODULE 5
Conformance to the Framework
- what does it mean to be conformant/compliant?
- measured by how close the model matches the framework
- conformance implies less rigid approach (don't use compliance)
- begin with first-level processes such as Order Handling and apply a conformance rating
- conformance is about equivalence; don't need exactly matching text
- conformance scores are not awarded to level one domains or core processes
- conformance scores are awarded to Tasks (level 3 and below) and Sub-tasks (level 4 and below)
	- Tasks are scored between 3.1 and 5
	- Sub-task scores are calculated as input to parent Task scores

MODULE 6
The Framework and Other Industry Process Models
- ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)
- COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology)
- PCF (Process Classification Framework)
- SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model)

ITIL
- four practice areas: service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation
- ITIL processes placed in the Enterprise domain since Enterprise domain defines policies for other domains
- GB921W - ITIL / eTOM
- GB921L
- GB921Q - FAQ
- TR143

COBIT 5
- good practices to control quality and risk
- two main process domains: governance; management
- governance has five processes: value delivery; risk management; resource management; performance measurement; strategic alignment
- management contains four domains: align, plan and organize; build/acquire and implement; deliver service and support; monitor, evaluate, and assess
- links business goals to IT goals
- COBIT book can be downloaded at no charge
- COBIT domains are aligned with eTOM vertical process categories
- "align, plan and organize" supports "strategy & commit"
- "build/acquire and implement" supports "infrastructure lifecycle management"
- "deliver service and support" supports some Operations verticals
- "monitor, evaluate and assess" supports the Enterprise domain's "enterprise effectiveness management" core process
- no mappings to the "billing and revenue management" vertical, nor to the "product lifecycle management" vertical

PCF
- process management and benchmarking
- can be downloaded at no charge
- there are no process descriptions of the first-level processes
- descriptions of the lower-level processes are available to members
- two groups: operating processes (similar to SIP and OPS); management and support services (similar to Enterprise Domain)
- each has six categories
- hundreds of processes
- difficult to map to eTOM

SCOR
- four reference areas: DCOR; CCOR; M4SC; PLCOR
- DCOR (design chain operations reference model): product and process design
- CCOR (customer chain operations reference model): sales and support
- M4SC (managing for supply chain performance)
- PLCOR (product lifecycle operations reference model)
- has both process frameworks and best practices information
- DCOR maps to several areas in the product domain and the enterprise domain
- CCOR maps to the market / sales domain and the customer domain
- M4SC maps to the engaged party domain
- PLCOR maps to the product lifecycle management vertical grouping
