# TAM - The Application Framework

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameworx#Telecom_Application_Map

- enterprise-wide decomposition and model of application functionality
- consistent common terminology
- separation of application neutral from application specific model
- automates the business processes in the eTOM

# Goals Achieved
1. Provide standard application requirements
2. Provide a common application language/common vocabulary
3. Enable process automation
4. Facilitate mergers & acquisitions
5. Guide efficient system architecture development and deployment

# Goals Achieved
1. Supporting procurement requests
2. Defining project scope
3. Cataloging application functionality
4. Designing an application architecture
5. Identifying application owners and users

# 9 Domains
1. market and Sales, 
2. Product, 
3. Customer, 
4. Service, 
5. Resource, 
6. `Supplier Partner` = (not yet  replaced by  `engaged party domain`).
7. Enterrise
8. **Cross Domain** , 
9. **Integration Infra** = (not in the SID nor the eTOM).

**three key concepts**:
- `Domains`
- `application`: a cluster of related functionalities; 
	-abstract logical description; "product": realization of an application
- `functionality`: textual description of a capability; may have many levels

**three basic themes**  
1. `task-centric`: collection of functionalities supporting a specific task; typically a business process
2. `entity-centric`: grouping based on a specific entity; typically an ABE
3. `utility-centric`: functionality pattern across the enterprise

# Using the Framework
- uses: 
	- common application language;
	- application inventory;
	- applicationa architecture reference map;
	- procurement support tool;
	- mergers & acquisitions rationalization;
	- application design;
	- ecosystem fitness;
	- market segmentation;
	- cataloguing functionality;
- common application language:
	- makes it easier to spread ideas
	- increases communications effectiveness
- application architecture reference map
- mergers and acquisitions
	- easier to identify integrations points
	- identify possible duplicates and candidates for rationalization
- application design
	- vendors are aligning...
- ecosystem fitness
- market segmentation
- cataloguing functionality

# Implementation Case Studies

## Ecosystem Fitness / System Integrator
- eliminate overlapping functionality
- define an application's scope
- common language
- application boundaries
- service assurance ecosystem / application clusters

## Business Transformation: A Service Provider View
- principles: service-oriented architecture; flexible and efficient; based on standards; use COTS
- principles delivered using all frameworks hand-in-hand
- enables focused discussions
- map existing apps to framework; highlights gaps and overlaps
- frameworks can help build an RFP

## COTS Design Example: An Independent Software Vendor (ISV) View
- problems: customer diversity; TCO; innovation
- used TAM for common language; reduce development risk; TCO reduction through re-use and volume
- used eTOM for standard structure and terminology; consistent work flows; understand and manage portfolios

# Extending the Framework
- grouping guidelines: 
	- by functional areas; 
	- by end user consumption; 
	- by purpose or objective; 
	- by lifecycle of a key business entity
- naming: noun phrase; avoid "&", "and", "/"; 
- must have at least two applications in the decomposition;

# Notes
TAM Domains = Apps specific to the management area
