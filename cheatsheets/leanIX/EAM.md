In a great workplace, employees are more engaged by having information in an understandable context and by feeling
confident that decisions are made based on facts. well-organized, consistent
and interconnected data.
Align IT with Business
Manage growing IT environments
Manage and optimize costs
Promote agility and innovation

Technical Debt
=============
The need to manage Application Portfolios increases with company size
Increase in IT costs
Increase in wasted spend
Increase Risk in compliance challenges
Slows the pace of innovation
Slows digital transformation
multiple similar Applications completing the same tasks
Applications that are unstable or are no longer used
outdated Applications that have never been uninstalled

main blockers for digital transformations
=========================================
Increased Costs
Legacy applications
IT security concerns
Application integration challenges
Missing alignment between business and IT
Unclear return on IT investment
Inflexible IT development processes
Cyber Threats
System Failures
Planning Limitations


## EA Questions
In which Applications to invest?
How well are Business Capabilities supported by Applications?
Who is using Applications where? Support gaps?
Who is providing the Application?
How does the Application portfolio evolve over time?
Is this inline with our business priorities?
Detect risks arising from obsolete IT Components
Identify Applications and IT Components that are planned to be, or already are phased out
How many IT Components are redundant?
Which Applications are at risk due to IT Components lifecycle?
What technology standards do we use?
Where are my IT Components located?
How does my Application portfolio adhere to security standards?
Is the data flow compromised?
Are the Applications technically suited?
How critical are integrations as part of a data flow?
Does a migration include lots of integrations to be rebuilt?
Technologies without Provider Support?
How are our applications interconnected?
What prevents us from phasing out applications?
Are certain applications a point of failure due to their high number of interfaces?
How critical are the applications in my data flow?
Which applications handle critical personal data?
How does my current interface landscape compare to my future state?
How are applications interacting with each other and how often?
Is the data flow compromised by outdated applications or technologies?
How reliable are my integrations?

Project Status: The Project Status view shows the status of the, with each application, associated projects. If at least one of those associated project has the status "red" the color of the application is also red. If none of the projects has the status "red", but at least one has the status "yellow" the application appears as yellow. If all projects have the status green, the application is also green. If there are no associated projects the application stays white.

Total Cost of IT Components: The Total Cost of IT Components view shows the IT component cost for the different applications. LeanIX differentiates between 0 and >600k.
Data Classification: The Data Classification view shows the sensitivity level of the data that is used, manipulated or utilized by an application. LeanIX differentiates between Public unclassified, Sensitive, Restricted and Confidential.
