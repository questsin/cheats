###  Business Transformation Management

## Increasing need to support transformations..
Migrate own data center workloads to public cloud
Rollout of global ERP system (S4HANA, Netsuite)
Modernize legacy / monolithic IT landscape
Merge or carve-out of businesses
Change of operating model (e.g. due to Covid-19)

## but lacking support of traditional approaches
Long term strategic roadmaps (3y/ 5y) too inflexible
Short term project management missing business context
Lacking traceability on how business objectives are achieved
Difficult to incorporate impacts on and contraint by architecture
Roadmaps often stay high level, no link to execution
Execution lacking streamlined update of EA documentation

## Ideal BTM Workflow
1. Begin with the business Expressing what objectives they want to achieve
2. Drive value by breaking down the transformation program into manageable initiative
3. Define Impact on the initiatives across your architecture that enables the transformation
4. Envision the transformation for a shifting end date
5. Consider multi-dimensional factors to drive effective Investment decision
