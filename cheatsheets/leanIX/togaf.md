Enterprise Architecture Capability

### ADM
## Preliminary Phase
Determine the Architecture Capability desired by the organization
Implementing the tool that supports the Architecture Capability
Identifying key drivers in the organizational context
Defining the framework and requirements for architecture work,
Evaluating the enterprise architecture maturity

## Phase A - Architecture Vision
Develop a vision of the capabilities and business value as a result of the proposed enterprise architecture.
Obtain approval for Architecture Work that defines the architecture Vision
The approach of phase A involves definition of what is in and outside the scope of the
architecture effort as well as the constraints that must be dealt with

## Phase B Business Architecture
Develop the Target Business Architecture
that describes how the enterprise needs to
operate to achieve the business goals, and
respond to the strategic drivers set out in
the Architecture Vision, in a way that
addresses the Request for Architecture
Work and stakeholder concerns
Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap
components based upon gaps between the
Baseline and Target Business Architectures

## Phase C - Information System Architecture
Clear definition of which applications will
serve as the system of record or reference
for enterprise master data.
Will there be an enterprise standard that all
application needs to adopt?
Understand how data entities are utilized by
business processes, functions and services
Understand how data entities are created,
stores, transported and reported.

## Phase D - Technology Architecture
Develop the Technology Architecture to
enables your Application and the correct
processing of Data Objects
Identify Architecture Roadmap components
based upon gaps between the Baseline and
Target Technology Architectures
Increase time-2-market by offering an
effective technology standards management

## Phase E - Opportunities & Solutions
ldentifies projects, programs or portfolios
identified in the previous phases can be
implemented
Generate the complete version of the
Architecture Roadmap, based upon the gap
analysis and Architecture Roadmap
components from Phases B, C, and D
ldentify Transition Architectures that will
deliver continuous business value

## Phase F - Migration Planning
Finalize the Architecture Roadmap and the
Implementation and Migration Plan
Ensure that the Implementation and
Migration Plan is coordinated with the
enterprise's approach to managing and
implementing change
Ensure that the business value, cost of work
packages and Transition Architectures are
understood by key stakeholders

## Phase G - Implementation Governance
Ensure conformance with the Target
Architecture by implementation projects
Perform appropriate Architecture
Governance functions for the solution and
any implementation-driven architecture
Change Requests

## Phase H - Change Management
The goal of an architecture change
management process is to ensure that the
architecture achieves its original target
business value.
This includes managing changes to the
architecture in a cohesive and architected
way.
This process will typically provide for the
continual monitoring of such things as
governance requests, new developments in
technology, and changes in the business
environment.
When changes are identified, change
management will determine whether to
formally initiate a new architecture
evolution cycle.

### Reports
Application Portfolio -(Count of Sheets) - The Application Portfolio Report helps you identify Applications that need your attention. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example 'Active' Applications that are Business Critical but have insufficient Technical Fit.
Application Portfolio -(Count of Sheets) - Functional fit vs. technical fit
Application Sourcing -- The Application Sourcing report shows you which IT Components are used by which User Group. Zoom in for a better view on your region of interest.
Application Matrix -- The Application Matrix report gives you a color-coded overview of your Applications, Business Capabilities and User Groups. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example 'Mission Critical' IT Components used by specific Business Capabilies and User Groups.
Application Matrix - TIME -- The Application Matrix report gives you a color-coded overview of your IT landscape by TIME model classification.
Application Landscape -- The Application Landscape report gives you a color-coded overview of your IT landscape. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example Applications used by a Business Capability, Process or User Group that are 'End of Life'.
Application Roadmap -- The Application Roadmap gives you a Lifecycle view of 'Planned', 'Phased in', 'Active' or 'Phased out' Applications. Drill down by 'Children', 'Successors', 'Projects' or 'IT Components' for different insights.
Application Usage -- The Application Usage report shows you which Applications are used by which User Group. Zoom in for a better view on your region of interest.
Interface Circle Map -- The Interface Circle Map report shows you how different Interfaces and Applications are linked to each other. Group them Alphabetically or by Business Capabilities and visualize connections between Interfaces, Provided Interfaces or Consumed Interfaces.
IT Component Matrix -- The IT Component Matrix report gives you a color-coded overview of your IT Components, Technical Stack and Providers. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example 'End of Life' IT Components that belong to specific Technical Stacks and Providers.
IT Component Landscape -- The IT Component Landscape report gives you a color-coded overview of your IT Components and Technical Stack. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example 'Applications: Functional Fit' that use 'End of Life' IT Components.
IT Component Location -- The IT Component Location report shows you which IT Components are used by which Country or Location. Zoom in for a better view on your region of interest.
IT Component Roadmap -- The IT Component Roadmap gives you a Lifecycle view of 'Planned', 'Phased in', 'Active' or 'Phased out' IT Components. Drill down by 'Children', 'Successors' or 'Applications' for different insights.
Business Capability Map -- The Business Capability Map gives you a hierarchical color-coded overview of your Business Capabilities. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example Business Capabilities that are marked as 'End of Life'.
Business Capability Cost -- This report gives you an overview of which Business Capabilities are supported by which Applications, and how much this support costs you annually. It helps you understand the cost allocation per Business Capability, and to analyze where costs could be reduced.
Business Capability Cost -- This report gives you an overview of which Business Capabilities are supported by which Applications, and how much this support costs you annually. It helps you understand the cost allocation per Business Capability, and to analyze where costs could be reduced.
Project Landscape -- The Project Landscape report gives you a color-coded overview of your Projects and Business Capabilities. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example Projects that are 'End of Life'.
Project Matrix -- The Project Matrix report gives you a color-coded overview of your Projects, Business Capabilities and Providers. Add filters and switch between different views to drill down until you find what you need, for example Projects of significant business value, that belong to specific Business Capabilities and Providers.
Project Portfolio -(Sum of Opex/CapEx)- The Project Portfolio Report groups Projects according to their Value and Risk. For example, it can help you identify Projects in a specific User Group or Business Unit that have high Business Value but have a Severe Risk.
Project Roadmap -- The Project Roadmap gives you a Lifecycle view of 'Planned', 'Phased in', 'Active' or 'Phased out' Projects. Drill down by 'Children', 'Successors' or 'Applications' for different insights.
Provider Portfolio -(Count of Sheets)- The Provider Portfolio Report groups Providers according to their 'Criticality' and 'Quality'. It can help you identify Providers that need to be replaced or renewed, for example.

Provider Cost -- The Provider Cost report shows you the cost allocation per Provider, either as a pie chart or in table view.
Lifecycle & Age -- The Lifecycle report lets you visualize 'Active' or 'Phased Out' Applications at any point in time, while the Age Structure report shows you how many of the current Applications have entered, or will be entering, the status 'Active' each year.
