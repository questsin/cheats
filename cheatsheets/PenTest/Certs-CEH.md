# hacking (5 stages)
1. Reconnaissance = (active/passive)
2. Scanning
3. Gaining access
4. Maintaining access
5. Clearing tracks

# Defense = Incident management
1. Prepare (ITSM, Polices, RACI, SOC)
2. Identify and Detect (IDS, SIEM, SOAR, AV)
3. Contain
4. Eradicate 
5. Recovery
6. Leasons learned
7. Polices
8. Guidelines 
9. Incident management 

# infosec (5)
1. Confidentiality, 
2. integrity, 
3. availability, 
4. authenticity, 
5. non-repudiation
