## Stats
A `Pearson correlation` is a number between -1 and 1 that indicates the extent to which two variables are linearly related. The Pearson correlation is also known as the “product moment correlation coefficient” (PMCC) or simply “correlation

`SMOTE`? Just like the name suggests, the technique generates synthetic data for the minority class. SMOTE proceeds by joining the points of the minority class with line segments and then places artificial points on these lines.

`Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)`
~`PCA` is principal components analysis. It takes a dataset and "rotates" it, taking the original axes defined by the original variables, and creating new axes that are linear combinations of the old data. The precise linear combinations are chosen such that each successive component maximizes variance along that new dimensions. A quick google search turns up lots of tutorials


`MICE` is "multiple imputaiton by chained equations". Basically, missing data is predicted by observed data, using a sequential algorithm that is allowed to proceed to convergence. (1) Start by filling in the missing data with plausible guesses at what the values might be. (2) for each variable, predict the missing values by modeling the observed values as a function of the other variables. At each step, update the predictions of the missing values. There are many tricky details, and many online tutorials. here is an article aimed at biostat practitioners:
