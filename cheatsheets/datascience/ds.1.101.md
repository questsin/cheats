# ML Apps
Supervised 
- Regression?? predict metrics
  - Support vector machines (SVMs) 
- Classification?? predict labels
  - Logistic regression = binary like yes/no
  - Support vector machines (SVMs) 
- reinforcement learning
Unsupervised
- Clustering
  - k-means clustering
  - support vector clustering
  - spectral clustering??
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation
