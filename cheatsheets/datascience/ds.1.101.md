- exploratory data analysis (eda)
  - granularity = hiecharcy
  - scope = georaphy, time coverage
  - temporality = events, time zones
  - faithfulness = actually captures reality > data cleansing
- math
  - tensor = matrix
  - probability
  - linear algebra
    - y =xb + e
    - matrices and vectors
    - scale up, generalise.
  - caculus
    - max/min
  - bayes theorem ~classification
  - bayes rule - a priori probabilities = upfront

# ML Apps
Supervised 
- Regression?? predict metrics
  - Support vector machines (SVMs) 
- Classification?? predict labels
  - Logistic regression = binary like yes/no
  - Support vector machines (SVMs) 
- reinforcement learning
Unsupervised
- Clustering
  - k-means clustering
  - support vector clustering
  - spectral clustering??
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation
